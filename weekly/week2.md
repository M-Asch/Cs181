## Projected Homework

HW | Day Out  | Day Due | Contents
:--|:--------|:--------|:------------
HW_1.3 | Monday | Wednesday | Building native 2D representations
HW_1.4 | Wednesday | Friday | List comprehensions and lambda functions
HW_1.5 | Friday | Monday |

## Tuesday Problem Day

List patterns and integration with LoL and DoL.


## Progression

Goal of the week is finish review topics and native Python representations so that we are in a place at the end of the week to read chapter 5 and set up and motivate the tabular data model.

Monday: Make sure we are all on the same page with respect to Python and file processing, lists and dictionaries.  

Wednesday: Complete representations with the List of Dictionaries with new material on list comprehensions and vector operations and lambda functions.

Friday: First half: complete Python features; second half: transition into data models and Part II of the textbook.
